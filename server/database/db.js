//Database connections take time â†’ We use async/await to handle them properly.
//async makes connectDB return a promise.
//await pauses execution until MongoDB is connected.
//This prevents race conditions where the program might continue before the connection is established.


//Promise	A value that will be available in the future.
//async function	Always returns a promise.
//await	Waits for a promise to resolve before continuing execution.
